# SRC

This directory houses all the pre-processed files.

Instead of using and maintaining Node build tools, I will be using an application called [Prepros](https://prepros.io). This highly configurable tool can compile almost all preprocessing languages like Sass, Less, Cssnext, Jade/Pug, Markdown, Slim, Coffeescript and more.
